# Privacy Policy

This document explains in detail the privacy policy of this app.

## Tracking and Analytics

This app does not track or store anything that can or cannot be used to identify you.

However, it uses services from Google that their privacy policy may differ. The author of this app does not have control
over their policy. This app does _not_ use Google Analytics.

Due to technical reasons, you may be asked to turn off tracking prevention mechanisms in your browser. This is because
these mechanisms may block third-party cookies which would hinder the normal operation of Google services.

## Authorization of access to Google account

This app requires access to your Google account. This is for opening, creating, editing, and saving level files in your
Google Drive.

This app does not access any file of your Drive that you did not explicitly open or create with this app.

This app _never_ deletes anything from your Google Drive.

This app does not have access to any other services including but not limited Calendar, Email, etc.

This app _**never**_ sends your access token (the key for accessing your Google account) to anyone except for the Google
server. The author of this app does not have access to your Google account.

You may de-authorize this app at any time at [Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions).

## Diagnostic information

The app does not send any information for diagnostic purposes. In the event of a failure, the app may ask you to send
diagnostic information manually to the author. You can choose to refuse sending this information. It cannot be used to
identify you.
